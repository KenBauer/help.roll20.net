__Macros__ are user-defined shortcuts to functions you regularly want to repeat.  Go to the Settings tab (housed under the small gear image) at the top right of the Roll20 interface.  To enter a macro, first type what you want to call the command.  Example: "*test*".  Then to the right, put in the command.  This could be typed text, a roll, or emote.  Press "Enter" after this information to save the command.  

  To use the macro, type _#_ and the command (so *#test*) and press enter.  There is also a tab auto-complete function for macros.
  
Multiple commands
--------
One of the strenghts of the macro system is it's ability to execute multiple actions with a single command. To do this, simply put each item on it's own line, and they will be executed in order when you run the macro.

###Example

If I want to create a macro that will include an emote, plus my attack and damage rolls it would look like this:

<code>#dagger</code>
<code>/me rams his dagger home</code><br>
<code>/roll 1d20+10  vs AC</code><br>
<code>/roll 1d4+9 Damage</code><br>

Then, simply by typing <code>#dagger</code> it would run the entire script and look like this: <img src="/images/AttackMacro.jpg" />

Using a variable with a Macro
--------
  If you'd like to use a variable modifier with your macro roll, simply end the macro command with the modifier, and then specify it when calling your macro
  
###Example
  
  If I want a macro for 1d20+x (<i>where x is my variable value</i>) I could create the following macro:
  <code>#d20+x</code> <code>/roll 1d20+</code>
  then, when running the macro, type <code>#d20+x</code><code>4</code> to get <code>/roll 1d20+4</code>
