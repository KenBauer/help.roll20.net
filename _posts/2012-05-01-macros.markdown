How to create and use macros

__Macros__ are user-defined shortcuts to functions you regularly want to repeat.  Go to the Tools tab (housed under the small gear image) at the top right of the Roll20 interface.  To enter a macro, first type what you want to call the command.  Example: "_test_".  Then to the right, put in the command.  This could be typed text, a roll, or emote.  Press "Enter" after this information to save the command.  

  To use the macro, type _#_ and the command (so _#test_) and press enter.  Know that there is a tab auto-complete function for macros.
