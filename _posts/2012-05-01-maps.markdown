* __Finding and adding maps__

  Be certain that you are on the background / map layer (accessed via the left side toolbar).  You can use the Art Library to quickly find maps to use in your campaign, by searching under the "maps" section in the drop down menu. There are some built-in assets, and if you scroll down further you’ll see that it’s also searching popular RPG forums and sites on the web.  After finding the appropriate map, you may simply drag and drop it into the table area.  Additionally, you can drag and drop maps directly from your computer to the Roll20 interface.


* __Using map tiles__

  You can make you own environments using tiles.  Search "tiles" via the Art Library, and then drag and drop the relevant tiles so you can arrange them in the table area.  You can also highlight a tile on the board and use Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V to copy and paste it if you need to make several of the same kind. 



* __Grids__

  At the top of the screen you can access the "Page Toolbar" menu.  Each individual page of your campaign is listed in the area.  Each section, upon right-clicking, has a unique settings menu which allows you to indicate whether the page will have a square grid, hex grid, or be gridless.
